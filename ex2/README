1.a. sigsetjmp - Put a "bookmark" in the code - save the stack context and CPU state in env for
 later use
 siglongjmp - Jumps to the code location to where the sigsetjmp has been called,
 and restore CPU state specified by env
 b. The sigsetjmp and the siglongjmp affect about the mask in this way:
    If savesigs is non-zero, saves the current signal mask as well, and
    if the signal mask was saved in sigsetjmp, it will be restored as well in siglongjmp
