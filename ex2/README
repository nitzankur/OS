1.a. sigsetjmp - Put a "bookmark" in the code to where we are in the code
 siglongjmp - Jumps to the code location to where the sigsetjmp has been called,
 and restore CPU state specified by env
 b. The sigsetjmp and the siglongjmp affect about the mask in this way:
    If the signal mask was saved in sigsetjmp, it will be restored as well
